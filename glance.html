Galleria Continua Via Vittorio <br> E. Orlando, 3 St. Regis<br> Rome,Italy</h4>

        <p> “Soprattutto is the beautiful title that Leandro Erlich has chosen for this exhibition in the new space opened by Galleria Continua at The St. Regis Rome. Literally meaning “sopra (over) every other thing, before and more than tutto (all)”: a concept that is dear to the Argentinian artist that amplifies the meaning of a thing through experience, collective sharing and imagination. We just need to look at his clouds to realise that they are something known, archetypal, but at the same time – observing them in their different immobilised and frozen forms in a wooden cabinet – they are something new that positions them above the conscience and brings us to a magical beyond that is associated with aesthetic meaning and poetry. </p>

            Etude des énergies dans l'espace

              <p>Sometime ago, I wrote that Leandro’s work situates itself in a place on the border between the possible and impossible, between that which we know and that which we imagine: a real threshold between what is real, or what we believe it to be, and that which it is not. In this space on the threshold, a thing can be 

                <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-5">“Before and more than everything”, <br> it can become “above all”</h4>

             <p>Because the artist always exists in a parallel reality, an intermediary phase between what we know and see and what we remember and share together with others. We all have had the experience of traveling by plane, some more, some less, but the mood and what each of us emotionally invests “on” the trip itself is different. </p>

              <p>The same thing goes for the landscape: the one seen from above when we’re landing in an aeroplane (in the exhibition it’ll probably be exhibited as a carpet that can be walked on) and the Roman one, with its buildings, roads and gardens that dialogue simultaneously with the clouds in the sky. What the artist communicates to us is that a relationship between clouds and territory exists and that the described place is something known that we recognize as natural, that we already see, but it’s also something strange and artificial. We find the same cloud boxed in front of us but also photographed in Rome’s sky.</p> 

              <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-5"> Free to move itself within the space <br>  “over every other thing”. </h4>

                <p>All of Leandro Erlich’s oeuvre fundamentally plays with the mind and with the viewer’s perception in order to redefine the spaces of daily life, to escape from the ordinary world and enter into the extraordinary one. Above and over all.”  </p>
